    "# 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The banking industry is highly competitive, with fixed-term deposits being a popular product among customers. A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution, which can only be withdrawn after a specified period, in return for a fixed interest rate ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp), 2024). To stay competitive, banks must continuously innovate to retain and attract new customers, often through targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Electric Bank**, has been running a series of telemarketing campaigns aimed at encouraging customers to subscribe to term deposits. However, these campaigns have not yielded the desired results. Despite extensive efforts, a significant number of customers are declining to make deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Telemarketing Campaign Overview\n",
    "- **Total Customers Contacted**: 41,176\n",
    "- **Total Subscriptions Achieved**: 4,640\n",
    "- **Cost Call Per Customers**: [25 dollars](https://www.cloudtalk.io/blog/how-much-does-call-center-software-cost/?_gl=1*q3ml5d*_up*MQ..*_ga*OTM4ODM3ODg4LjE3MjM0NDExNjY.*_ga_SMHV632SNF*MTcyMzQ1MTA5NS4yLjAuMTcyMzQ1MTA5NS4wLjAuMA..) -> 23 euros\n",
    "- **Minimum Deposit**: [500 euro](https://www.activobank.pt/simple-account)\n",
    "- **Total Cost of Calls**: 41,176 customers * 23 euros = 947,048 euros\n",
    "- **Total Revenue from Subscriptions**: 4,640 subscriptions * 500 euros = 2,320,000 euros\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Conversion Rate Calculation\n",
    "**Conversion Rate** is a key performance indicator that measures the percentage of customers who take a desired action—in this case, subscribing to a term deposit—out of the total customers contacted. It is a critical metric because it directly reflects the effectiveness of the marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Conversion Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Subscriptions Achieved}}{\\text{Total Customers Contacted}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{4,640}{41,176} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 11.27\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An 11.27% conversion rate, while a solid performance, still lags behind the top performers in the financial industry, who are converting at a rate of 23% ([Ruler Analytics](https://www.ruleranalytics.com/blog/reporting/financial-services-marketing-statistics/#:~:text=Marketers%20in%20the%20financial%20services,at%20a%20rate%20of%2023%25)). This gap highlights the need for Electric Bank to improve its telemarketing strategy to reach the success levels seen by industry leaders. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 ROMI Calculation\n",
    "**Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)**, also known as marketing ROI, is a metric used to determine how much revenue marketing efforts generate compared to how much was spent on them. ROMI is typically calculated in regard to a specific marketing activity, channel ([Improvado](https://improvado.io/blog/return-on-marketing-investment)). It is a crucial tool for predicting future cash flow, making better decisions on budget allocation, and comparing the marketing efficiency of different activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ROMI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost of Calls}}{\\text{Total Cost of Calls}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{2,320,000 - 947,048}{947,048} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 144.92\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric Bank’s ROMI of 144.92% indicates that for every euro spent on telemarketing, the bank generates an additional 1.45 euros in profit. However, this figure is below the industry benchmark of 5:1 or 500%, which is considered a good ROMI ([Improvado](https://improvado.io/blog/return-on-marketing-investment)). This suggests that there is substantial room for improvement in the profitability of the bank's marketing efforts, as achieving a higher ROMI is essential for ensuring that marketing investments yield substantial returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.4 Target\n",
    "- **0**: Not subscribe to term deposit\n",
    "- **1**: Subscribe to term deposit\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "Given the modest conversion rate of 11.27% and a ROMI of 144.92%, there is a critical need to refine our telemarketing approach. Therefore, we need to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By doing so, Electric Bank aims to focus its telemarketing efforts on high-potential customers, thereby **increasing the conversion rate** and **improving ROMI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1 Specific Question\n",
    "- What customers should we focus our telemarketing efforts on in order to increase the conversion rate and improving ROMI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of this project are:\n",
    "- **Increase Conversion Rate While Reducing Telemarketing Costs**: Identify and target potential subscribers more effectively to maximize the efficiency and impact of each call.\n",
    "- **Improve Telemarketing ROMI**: Enhance the Return On Marketing Investment (ROMI) by improving the efficiency of the telemarketing campaign that impact to profit increasing. \n",

    "|            | **Predicted: Not Subscribed (0)** | **Predicted: Subscribed (1)** |\n",
    "|------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n",

    "| **Actual: Subscribed (1)**     | **False Negative (FN)** <br> Model predicts that the customer will not subscribe to a term deposit but they do | **True Positive (TP)** <br> Model predicts that the customer will subscribe to a term deposit and they do |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Types and Consequences**\n",
    "- **Type 1 Error: False Positive**\n",
    "  - **Consequence**: Wasteful expenditure on unnecessary telemarketing efforts towards customers who are unlikely to convert. This misuse of resources increases operational costs and reduces the ROAS of the campaign.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Type 2 Error: False Negative**\n",
    "  - **Consequence**: Missed opportunities for subscriptions. Failing to identify and target potential subscribers can lead to lower conversion rates and potential revenue losses for the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only focus on **positive predicted** label, we conduct cost analysis as below\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.1 Cost Analysis\n",
    "Below are the net gains associated with each possible prediction outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positive (TP):**\n",
    "  - Net Gain: 500 euros (deposit revenue) − 23 euros (call cost) = 477 euros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Positive (FP):**\n",
    "  - Net Gain:  0 euros (no revenue) − 23 euros (call cost) = − 23 euros\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Negative (TN):**\n",
    "  - Net Gain: 0 euros (no revenue, no cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Negative (FN):**\n",
    "  - Net Gain: 0 euros (no revenue, no cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Evaluation Metric**\n",
    "- **Precision**: Chosen because the cost of false positives (predicting that a client will subscribe when they actually won’t) is high. With precision, we can focus on ensuring that the clients we predict as likely to subscribe are indeed the ones who will do so, which directly supports the goal of reducing unnecessary telemarketing efforts.\n",
